#about
The project is a website designed to address the pervasive issues of algorithmic bias, whitening, and digital colonization in AI art generation. It replicates the familiar interface of the Midjourney page but diverges by focusing exclusively on producing Black-centered images and art. The goal is to challenge the existing biases within generative AI systems, which often default to Eurocentric aesthetics, and to create a digital space that amplifies Black representation. Present day AI models often reflect a Western-centric gaze, resulting from datasets primarily trained on Eurocentric images, leading to underrepresentation and misrepresentation of Black features, culture, and stories. This project deliberately inverts that bias, prioritizing images rooted in Black beauty, aesthetics, and narratives. Itâ€™s a statement against the erasure that occurs within tech development and an attempt to reimagine AI as a tool for everybody. By generating images that are unapologetically Black in subject and style, the project highlights the urgency for equitable AI training data, interfaces, and outputs that genuinely reflect the diversity of human experiences.
